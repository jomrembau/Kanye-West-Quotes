Kanye Says

Description
This is my solution for the challenge from Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code on Udemy. Starter files were provided, and I only coded the defined function get_quote(). The program displays a background image, a button, and fetches a Kanye West quote via the kanye.rest API
 when the button is clicked.

Features

* Display a background image.

* Show a default text on the canvas.

* Fetch and display a random Kanye West quote via API.

* Button triggers the quote update.

Requirements

* Python 3.x

* tkinter (usually included with Python)

* requests library (pip install requests)

* background.png and kanye.png image files

Usage

* Clone or download the repository.

* Ensure background.png and kanye.png are in the same folder as the script.

* Run main.py (or your script file).

* Click the Kanye button to fetch a new quote.

Credits

* Dr. Angela Yu – 100 Days of Code Udemy course.

* kanye.rest
 API for quotes.
